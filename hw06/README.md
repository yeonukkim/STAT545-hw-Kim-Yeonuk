# HW06_yeonuk

[Go to the homework!](https://github.com/yeonukkim/STAT545-hw-Kim-Yeonuk/blob/master/hw06/hw06_yeonuk.md)

## Brief reflection

I've worked for **2. Writing functions, 4. Work with the singer data, 6. Work with a nested data frame**

### 1. Writing functions

One thing I need to mention is that *Knit* did not work when the new function stops because of wrong input data. I tried to test warning message when an input is wrong as the below figure, but did not include these chunks in the hw Rmd file. With these chunks, the *Knit* did not work. I don't know how to deal with this problem at this point.
