## Brief reflection

I used the data which we used at the class. I added 5 features which are recomended or others.

1. Using *absolutePanel* to describe my information.
2. Using *img(src = "imagename.png")* to add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI
3. Using *checkboxGroupInput* to get multiple input.
4. Using *uiOutput* to give user example and getting input at the same time.
5. Using *tabsetPanel* to place two histogramsin separate tabs.
6. Using *DT::dataTableOutput()* to make a interactive table
7. Using *leaflet* with *ggmap::geocode* to make a map for UBC liquor store.
