Homework
--------

### Task 1: Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

### Task 2: Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.

### Task 4: How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?

### Task 6: Find countries with interesting stories. Open-ended and, therefore, hard.
