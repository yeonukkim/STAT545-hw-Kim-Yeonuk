## Links to homework

(MD file)[]

## Reflection

- The specific reflections for the each part is in the md file.
- Oveall, I tried to use not only required functions but also functions we learned previously. (e.g. join)
- While doing this homework, I understanded more about factor. 
- read_csv is much more convinient than read.csv since the first one import file as a data frame.
Thank you.
