Brief reflection
----------------

I did not add many features... sorry. 
Anyway, what I did is add new option that can make a log-log scale figure.
default value is FALSE.

My challenge is launching package to GitHub.
I initially started with github repository, but this repository included readme file and license.
I got to know that readme file is not needed when I make a repository, so I removed all the files in the web repository.
But, this might cause problem... I cannot push.... and I got to know that I cannot change to new repository for the local project even.
So, I made a new project, and reworked.
