Homework 02: Explore Gapminder and use dplyr
============================================

Bring rectangular data in
-------------------------

> library(gapminder)
>
> library(tidyverse)

Smell test the data
-------------------

-   Is it a data.frame, a matrix, a vector, a list?
-   What’s its class?
-   How many variables/columns?
-   How many rows/observations?
-   Can you get these facts about “extent” or “size” in more than one way? Can you imagine different functions being useful in different contexts?
-   What data type is each variable?
